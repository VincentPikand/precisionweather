# Precision Weather
### Node.js, React Native, Express.
## Description
Precision Weather's objective is to calculate how accurate are weather forecasts.
IT fetches several weather API's every day at 10 AM UTC, saving the 24-hour forecast to a database. When 24 hours have passed, it checks what the actual weather is and then calculates the forecasts accuracy overtime.<br/>
